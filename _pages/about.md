Welcome
======
Welcome to my site. I'm an Econ PhD Student at University of Kentucky. I have receive my MS in Economics from the University of
            Kentucky. My undergraduate majors were mathematics, economics and French Literature/Language at Transylvania
            University. My research interests are in macroeconmics and public finance. I explore questions of how policy or shocks have hetereogenous effects on heterogenous groups. I also have interest in bridging the gap of data science and economics. In my teaching I try to find ways to incorpoate open source tools (such as python and jupyter notebooks) in economics and statistics classes. Currently, I work as a data science intern at Quicken Loans. Feel free to contact me!
